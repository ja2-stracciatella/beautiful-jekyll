JA2 is still regarded as one of the very best turn-based strategy  titles ever made. No true successor to the game that can even roughly reach it's high standards has been created as of today (2018). Most of the popularity and fame, the Jagged Alliance franchise enjoys up to this day, basically derives from this one title.

Like with many good games, it's hard to describe what exactly makes JA2 so great. It's probably the unique way it throws the best parts of several genres into a blender. This includes TBS, RPG, Simulation and more. Add a high level of immersion, high replay value and obvious passion and dedication from the developer's side and you get... JA2!
JA2 was first released for Windows by TalonSoft and later ported to Linux by Tribsoft in 2000.
