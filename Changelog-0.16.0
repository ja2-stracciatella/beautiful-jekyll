builds.

__Build changes__:
 - the build system is now based on cmake
 - JA2S now uses several updated dependencies, including SDL2
 - FLTK is required if you want to have the GUI launcher
 - rust is required, but cmake will take care of the extra modules

_Warning_: SDL 2.0.6 is known to be buggy, so use a newer or older
version. Otherwise we will disable all audio if we detect it!

From the next release onward, the project will start using c++11
features. Let us know if you're stuck with an ancient compiler.
