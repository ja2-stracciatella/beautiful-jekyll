title: Release 0.18.0
---

The Jagged Alliance 2 Stracciatella team is proud to present a new release. It includes several new features, plenty of bugfixes compared to previous versions and the original game,  clean-ups of the old code base, and most notably much more work in externalizing hardcoded game data.

Through 479 commits at least 30 bugs were fixed, 5 of which are known to affect vanilla.

__New Features__:
  - Modding improvements
    - Several hardcoded values and assumptions are now externalized to additional json files for easy editing (SAM sites, merchants, game items, M.E.R.C. soldiers, sector info, weapon cache location, strategic AI policy, NPC placement)
    - Initial scripting support via lua scripts
    - Supporting Unfinished Business tilesets
    - Support for ogg and mp3 audio formats
  - Configurable game speed (set ms_per_time_slice in game.json)
  - Self-contained AppImage Linux builds
  - Preliminary Android build (beware: not adapted for touch input)
  - A chance-to-hit F hotkey

We are shipping pre-built packages for Linux, Windows and OS X. This should help users to easily get started with Jagged Alliance 2 Stracciatella. For users willing to take a risk we also provide automatically created [nightly builds](http://builds-ja2.stefanlau.com/nightlies/).

__Download__:
[http://ja2-stracciatella.github.io/download/](http://ja2-stracciatella.github.io/download/)
Make sure to uninstall any previous versions before installing.

__Build changes__:
 - a C++17 compatible compiler is now required

_Warning_: **SDL2 2.0.6 on Linux**  has a fatal bug in the audio conversion code. As a workaround, the game automatically disables all sounds if it detects this version during startup. Please downgrade to version 2.0.5 or use **version 2.0.7 or later**.
