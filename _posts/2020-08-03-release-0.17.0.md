title: Release 0.17.0
---

The Jagged Alliance 2 Stracciatella team is proud to present a new release. Over two years in the making, it
includes several new features, plenty of bugfixes compared to previous versions and the original game, more
work in externalizing data and innumerable clean-ups of the old code base. Also notable is the better launcher
experience and easier tweaking of settings for power users and modders.

Through over 1520 commits at least 61 bugs were fixed, 28 of which affect vanilla.

__New Features__:

- A redesigned [graphical launcher](https://ja2-stracciatella.github.io/#gui-launcher) with more toggles,
multiple mod support and the location of the main settings file (game.json)
- Data files are now searched for in several places and more [easily overriden](https://ja2-stracciatella.github.io/how-to-run/#extra-configuration-and-modding)
- Several hardcoded values and assumptions are now externalized to json files for easy editing
- Basic [Wildfire and Night Ops support](https://ja2-stracciatella.github.io/features/#wildfire-support)
- Several new standalone optional [mini-mods](https://ja2-stracciatella.github.io/#bundled-optional-mini-mods) 
- The map editor now works out of the box, using bundled dummy graphics
- Several smaller features like IMP import and better screen scaling options

We are shipping pre-built packages for Ubuntu, Windows and OS X. This should help users to easily get started
with Jagged Alliance 2 Stracciatella. For users willing to take a risk we also provide automatically created
[nightly builds](http://builds-ja2.stefanlau.com/nightlies/).

__Download__:
[http://ja2-stracciatella.github.io/download/](http://ja2-stracciatella.github.io/download/)
Make sure to uninstall any previous versions before installing.

__Build changes__:
 - a C++11 compatible compiler is now required
 - Dependency on boost has been removed
 - New dependency: string theory, a string library (also bundled in the repo)

_Warning_: **SDL2 2.0.6 on Linux**  has a fatal bug in the audio conversion code. As a workaround, the
game automatically disables all sounds if it detects this version during startup. Please downgrade
to version 2.0.5 or use **version 2.0.7 or later**.
